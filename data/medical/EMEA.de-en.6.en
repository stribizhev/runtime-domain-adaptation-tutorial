PegIntron alone:
PegIntron, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year.
If you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, depending upon your kidney function.
PegIntron alone was not studied in HCV/HIV co-infected patients.
All patients:
If you are injecting PegIntron yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed for you is clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.
If you have the impression that the effect of PegIntron is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
PegIntron is intended for subcutaneous use.

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, PegIntron can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Although not all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do.
Some people get depressed when taking PegIntron alone or in combination treatment with ribavirin, and in some cases people had suicidal thoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others).
Some patients have actually committed suicide.
Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour.
You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour.
Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: chest pain; changes in the way your heart beats; breathing problems (including shortness of breath), confusion; feeling depressed, wanting to harm yourself, hallucinations, numbness or tingling feeling; dizziness, convulsion ("fit"); trouble sleeping, thinking or concentrating; difficulty remaining alert, severe stomach pain or cramps;
Your doctor will test your blood to ensure that your white blood cell (cells that fight infection) and red blood cell (cells that carry oxygen) counts, platelets (blood clotting cells) and other laboratory values are at acceptable levels.
Other side effects that may occur with the combination of PegIntron and ribavirin capsules include:
Very commonly reported side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in every 10 patients):
Irritation or redness (and rarely, skin damage) at the site of injection, headache, tired feeling, shaking chills, fever, flu-like symptoms, weakness, loss of weight, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or loose stools, stomach pain, vomiting, muscle aches, pain in joints and muscles, feeling depressed, irritability, trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling anxious or nervous, difficulty concentrating, mood swings, hair loss, itching, dry skin, sore throat, coughing, difficult breathing, dizziness, virus infection, rash, and dry mouth.

The following rare and very rare events have been reported with PegIntron:
Rarely reported side effects (at least 1 in every 10,000 patients, but less than 1 in every 1,000 patients):
Diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.
Very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients):
Very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported.
Loss of consciousness has occurred very rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses.
Cases of stroke (cerebrovascular events) have been reported.
Check with your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.
Very rarely, PegIntron alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia.
Pure red cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been reported.
This causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy.
Additionally, the following events have been reported with PegIntron: facial palsy (weakness and slumping on one side to the face) and severe allergic reactions such as angioedema (an allergic skin disease characterized by patches of circumscribed swelling involving the skin and its subcutaneous layers, the mucous membranes, and sometimes the internal organs), toxic epidermal
282 necrolysis/Stevens Johnson Syndrome/erythema multiforme (a spectrum of rashes with varying degree of severity including death which may be associated with blisters in the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucosal membranes and sloughing of the affected area of the skin), mania (excessive or unreasonable enthusiasm), bipolar disorders (mood disorders characterized by alternating episodes of sadness and excitement), pericardial effusion (a fluid collection that develops between the pericardium (the lining of the heart) and the heart itself), pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart).
Additionally, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, skin and the membranes of the ears, brain and spinal cord) has been reported with PegIntron use.
When PegIntron is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not occurred at all.
If you are receiving HAART, the addition of PegIntron and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called platelets).
The following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of PegIntron and ribavirin capsules (adults) in HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving HAART: oral candidiasis (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, CD4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
